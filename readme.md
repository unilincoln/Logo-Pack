# University of Lincoln Logo Pack

This pack is maintained as a 'best effort' by members of the University's Online Services Team and LNCD Group. If you are unfamiliar with the guidelines around its use or wish to see the latest version you should always refer to the University of Lincoln's [Corporate Identity Guidelines](http://lincoln.ac.uk/identity).

The University of Lincoln Crest is copyrighted to the University and can only be used with our permission. The Crest and the 'University of Lincoln' text, which form the logo, should never be modified in any way.

### Print & Screen Versions

Both the Graphic and Micro versions of the logo include versions for print (CMYK colour space) and screen (RGB colour space) usage.

All Adobe Illustrator files include colour swatches of valid colour's for the Crest. Note that the wording "University of Lincoln" must only appear in black, white or block silver (depending upon the background).

## Logo Usage

The logo should only appear once on a single sheet or web page. In print, it should not be used any smaller than 20mm in width for the portrait version and 50mm for the landscape logotype.

On publications such as information sheets, leaflets, posters and newsletters, the logo should be used on the top right-hand corner of the page. If this is not possible, the bottom right-hand corner may be used instead.

The logo appears on the top left hand side of our website, in keeping with web conventions.

### Logo size and positioning

The 'exclusion zone' is the clear area that surrounds the University's logo. To ensure that the logo remains clear and has impact, nothing should appear inside the exclusion zone. In print form, the logo should not be used smaller than than 15mm, measured as the width of the actual Crest.

* The exclusion zone for the portrait (square) logo should be 15% of the height of the logo.
* The exclusion zone for the landscape logo should be 25% of the height of the logo.

If the logo is positioned over a background image, this can be considered clear space as long as it does not impair the visibility or legibility of the logo.

A micro version of the logo is intended for use at very small scale or where less detail is required e.g. on a pen barrel or embroidery. If the resolution is so low as to render the text illegible, it may be discarded. However the words University of Lincoln should be included somewhere at a legible resolution.
